# the-dating-program
This project is about a simplifid simulation of mate selection process of the society. It's a programming contest project that I got from my friend while he was working in Tecent. I didn't participate the contest but this wrote this project based on the given specs of that contest.

This project contains:
  1. the specification of the project.
  2.the report that I wrote to tell details of my project.
  3.the source code of my project
  4.the source code of my friend's project from which I borrowed some basic ideas.
 
Please note that this is my very first "formal" project since I started learning c++, if you happened to see this project please
feel free to share your thoughts with me no matter it's a better algorithm or data structure to implement the project or some insight 
on how to make my code more succint or whatever  that comes to your mind. I have to admit I'm still a novice and expecting your input 
to sharpen my skills. Many thx.
